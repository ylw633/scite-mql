    <content>
      <p>MetaQuotes Language 4 (MQL4) is a new built-in language for programming of trading
      strategies. This language allows to create your own Expert Advisors that make
      trading management automated and are perfectly suitable for implementing of one's
      own trade strategies. Besides, one can use MQL4 for creation of one's own Custom 
      Indicators, Scripts, and Libraries. You can start learning the language using Sergey Kovalyov's book named 
      <i>Programming in Algorithmic Language MQL4</i> published and supported by 
      <a target="_blank" href="http://www.metaquotes.net/?source=metaeditor_help">MetaQuotes Software Corp.</a>
      You can download the Book in .chm format at: <a href="http://www.mql4.com/files/mql4bookenglish.chm?source=metaeditor_help">http://www.mql4.com/files/mql4bookenglish.chm</a> (size 2.0 Mb).</p>
      
      <p>A large amount of functions necessary for analysis of the current and 
      previously income quotes, as well as basic arithmetic and logic operations are included in MQL4 
      structure. There are also basic indicators built in and commands of order 
      placement and control.</p>
      
      <p>The MetaEditor 4 (text editor) that highlights different constructions of MQL4 
      language is used for writing the program code. It helps users to orientate themselves in 
      the expert system text quite easily. We use MetaQuotes Language Dictionary as a Help System for MQL4 language. 
      An abridged guide contains functions divided into categories, operations, reserved words, and other language 
      constructions and allows finding the description of every element we use.</p>
      
      <p>Programs written in MetaQuotes Language 4 have different features and purposes:</p>
      <ul><li><p>
          <strong>Expert Advisor</strong> is a mechanical trading system (MTS) linked up to a certain chart. 
          An Advisor starts to run with every incoming tick for a given symbol. The Advisor will not be launched for a new, 
          tick if it is processing the previous one at this moment (i.e., the Advisor has not completed its operation yet).
          The Advisor can both inform you about a possibility to trade and trade at an account automatically sending orders 
          directly to the trade server. Like most trading systems, the terminal supports testing strategies on history data 
          with displaying trading in-and-out points in the chart.<br/>
          Experts are stored in <em>terminal_directory\experts</em>.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Custom Indicator</strong> is a technical indicator written independently in addition to those 
          already integrated into the client terminal. Like built-in indicators, they cannot trade automatically 
          and are intended for implementing of analytical functions only.<br/>
          Custom Indicators are stored in <em>terminal_directory\experts\indicators</em>.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Script</strong> is a program intended for a single execution of some actions. Unlike 
          Expert Advisors, Scripts are not run tickwise, but on request.<br/>
          Scripts are stored in <em>terminal_dictionary\experts\scripts</em>.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Library</strong> is a set of custom functions containing programs most frequently used. Libraries cannot start execution by itself.<br/>
          Libraries are recommended to be stored in <em>terminal_directory\experts\libraries</em>.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Included file</strong> is a source text of the most frequently used blocks of custom programs. 
          Such files can be included into the source texts of experts, scripts, custom indicators, and libraries at the compiling stage. 
          The use of included files is more preferable than the use of libraries because of additional burden occurring 
          at calling library functions.<br/>
          Included files are recommended to be stored in <em>terminal_directory\experts\include</em></p></li>

    <content>
      <p>Any program operates with data. Data can be of different types depending on their purposes. For example,
      integer data are used to access to array components. Price data belong to those of double precision with floating point.
      This is related to the fact that no special data type is foreseen for price data in MQL 4.</p>
      <p>Data of different types are processed with different rates. Integer data are processed at the fastest.
      To process the double precision data, a special co-processor is used. However, because of complicity of internal presentation
      of data with floating point, they are processed slower than the integer ones. String data are processed at the longest because of 
      dynamic computer memory allocation/reallocation.</p>
      <p>The main data types are:</p>
      <ul><li><a href="help://basis_types_integer">Integer (int)</a></li>
          <li><a href="help://basis_types_bool">Boolean (bool)</a></li>
          <li><a href="help://basis_types_literal">Literals (char)</a></li>
          <li><a href="help://basis_types_string">Strings (string)</a></li>
          <li><a href="help://basis_types_double">Floating-point number (double)</a></li>
          <li><a href="help://basis_types_color">Color (color)</a></li>
          <li><a href="help://basis_types_datetime">Date and time (datetime)</a></li>
      </ul>
      <p>The <em>color</em> and <em>datetime</em> types make sense only to facilitate visualization 
      and enter those parameters that had been set from expert advisor property tab or custom indicator 
      &quot;Inputs&quot; tab. The data of <em>color</em> and <em>datetime</em> types are represented 
      as integer values. <em>int</em> and <em>double</em> are called arithmetic (numeric) types.</p>
      <p>Only implicit <a href="help://basis_types_casting">type casting</a> is used in <a href="help://basis_operations_expression">expressions</a>.</p>

      caption=Type casting
      <content>
        <p>Only implicit type casting is used in MQL 4 <a href="help://basis_operations_expression">expressions</a>. The type priority grows at casting:</p>
        <pre class="docmql4">
int  (bool,color,datetime);
double;
string;</pre>
        <p>Before operations (except for the assignment ones) are performed,  the data have been conversed 
        into the maximum priority type. Before assignment operations are performed, the data have been cast into the target type.</p>
        <p class="doctabhdr">Examples:</p>
        <pre class="docmql4">
int    i = 1 / 2;     // no types casting, the result is 0
int    i = 1 / 2.0;   // the expression is cast to the double type, then is to the target type of int, the result is 0
double d = 1.0 / 2.0; // no types casting, the result is 0.5
double d = 1 / 2.0;   // the expression is cast to the double type that is the same as the target type, the result is 0.5
double d = 1 / 2;     // the expression of the int type is cast to the target type of double, the result is 0.0
string s = 1.0 / 8;   // the expression is cast to the double type, then is to the target type of string, the result is &quot;0.12500000&quot; (the string containing 10 characters)
string s = NULL;      // the constant of type int is cast to the target type of string, the result is &quot;0&quot; (the string containing 1 character)
string s = &quot;Ticket #&quot;+12345; // the expression is cast to the string type that is the same as the target type, the result is &quot;Ticket #12345&quot;
</pre>
        <p>Type casting is applied to not only constants, but also <a href="help://basis_variables">variables</a> of corresponding types.</p>

        <p>Floating-point constants consist of an integer part, a point (.), and a fractional part. The integer 
        and the fractional parts represent sequences of decimal numbers.</p>
        <p class="doctabhdr">Examples:</p>

        <p>String constant is a sequence of ASCII-code characters enclosed in double quotes: &quot;Character constant&quot;.</p>
        
      <p>A string constant is an array of characters enclosed in quotes. It is of the string type. 
      If there is a need to insert a double quote (&quot;) into the string, a reverse slash (\) must be put before it. 
      Any special <a href="help://basis_types_literal">character constants</a> can be inserted into the string if they have a reverse slash (\) before them. 
      The length of a string constant lies between 0 and 255 characters.

      <content>
<p>Color constants can be represented in three ways: literally, by integers, or by name (for named Web colors only).</p>

<p>Literal representation consists of three parts representing numerical rate values of three main color components: red,
green, blue. The constant starts with C and is enclosed in single quotes. Numerical rate values of a color component lie in the range 
from 0 to 255.</p>

<p>Integer-valued representation is written in a form of hexadecimal or a decimal number. A hexadecimal number looks 
like 0x00BBGGRR where RR is the rate of the red color component, GG - of the green one, and BB - of the blue one. Decimal constants 
are not directly reflected in RGB. They represent a decimal value of the hexadecimal integer representation.</p> 

<p>Specific colors reflect the so-called <a href="help://constants_colors">Web colors set</a>.</p>

<p class="doctabhdr">Examples:</p>
<pre class="docmql4">
// symbol constants
C'128,128,128'    // gray
C'0x00,0x00,0xFF' // blue
// named color

// integer-valued representation
0xFFFFFF          // white
16777215          // white
0x008000          // green
32768             // green

<p>Datetime constants can be represented as a literal line consisting of 6 parts for values of year, month, 
date, hours, minutes, and seconds. The constant is enclosed in single quotes and starts with D.
Either date (year, month, date) or time (hours, minutes, seconds), or both can be skipped.
Datetime constant can vary from Jan 1, 1970 to Dec 31, 2037.</p>
<p class="doctabhdr">Examples:</p>
<pre class="docmql4">

     Some characters and character sequences are of a special importance. These are so-called operation symbols, for example:
<pre class="docmql4">
+ - * / %     symbols of arithmetic operations
&amp;&amp; ||         symbols of logic operations
= += *=       symbols of assignment operations</pre>
     <p>Operation symbols are used in expressions and have sense when appopriate operands are given them<br/><br/>
     Punctuation marks are emphasized, as well. These are parentheses, braces, comma, colon, and semicolon.<br/><br/>
     Operation symbols, punctuation marks, spaces are used to separate language elements from each other.</p>

<p>An expression consists of one or more operands and operation characters. An expression can be written in several lines.</p>
<p class="doctabhdr">Examples:</p>

    (w + 2) + 127;</pre>

 <p>There can be only one operation of assignment in an expression. Bitwise operations are performed with integer 
numbers only. The logical shift operation uses values of x less than 5 binary digits. The greater digits are rejected, 
so the shift is for the range of 0 to 31 bit. By %= operation (y value by module of x), the result sign is equal to the sign of divided number.</p>

<p><b>Indexing</b><br/>

<p class="doctabhdr">Example:</p>
<pre class="docmql4">array[i] = 3; //Assign the value of 3 to the i-th element of the array.</pre><br/>

<p>Only an integer can be index of an array. Four-dimensional and below arrays are allowed. Each measurement is 
        indexed from 0 to <b>measurement size</b>-1. In particular case, for a one-dimensional array consisting of 50 elements,  
        the reference to the first element will look like array[0], that to the the last element will array[49].</p>

        <p>At access beyond the array, the executing subsystem will generate the error of <a href="help://constants_errors">ERR_ARRAY_INDEX_OUT_OF_RANGE</a>

<p><b>Call for function with x1,x2,...,xn arguments.</b><br/>
Each argument can represent a constant, a variable, or an expression of the corresponding type. The arguments passed are separated by commas and must
be inside of parentheses, the opening parenthesis to follow the name of the called function.<br/><br/>
The expression value is the value returned by the function. If the returned value is of the void type, such function call cannot be 
placed to the right in the assignment operation. Please make sure that the expressions x1,x2,...,xn are executed exactly in this order.</p>
<p class="doctabhdr">Example:</p>

<p>Language operators describe some algorithmic operations that must be executed to accomplish a task. The program
body is a sequence of such operators. Operators following one by one are separated with a semicolon.<br/><br/>
One operator can occupy one or several lines. Two or more operators can be located in the same line. Operators 
that control over the execution order (if, if-else, switch, while and for) can be nested into each other.</p>

      becomes false. If it is false, the cycle will be terminated, and the control will be given to the next operator. <em>Expression3</em> 
      is calculated after each iteration.</p>
      <pre class="docmql4"><i>for (Expression1; Expression2; Expression3)

        <p>Any of the three or all three expressions can be absent in the <em>for</em> operator, but the semicolons (;) that 
separate them must not be omitted. If Expression2 is omitted, it is considered constantly true. The <em>for</em> (;;) operator is a 
continuous cycle equivalent to the <em>while(1)</em> operator. Either expression 1 or 3 can consist of several expressions combined by a comma operator ','.</p>

      <p>Function is a named part of a program that can be called from other parts of the program so many times as 
      it is necessary. It consists of type definition for the value to be returned, name, formal parameters, and a composite operator  
      (block) of actions to be performed. Amount of passed parameters is limited and cannot exceed 64.</p>
      <p class="doctabhdr">Example:</p>
<pre class="docmql4">double                       // type of value to be returned
linfunc (double x, double a, double b) // function name and parameters list
{
                             // composite operator
   return (a + b);           // returned value
 }</pre>
 
      <p>The "return" operator can return the value of the expression included into this operator. If necessary, the 
      expression value can be transformed into the type of function result. A function that does not return values must be of "void" type.</p>
      <p class="doctabhdr">Example:</p>
<pre class="docmql4">
void errmesg(string s)
  {
   Print(&quot;error: &quot;+s);
  }</pre>

        <p>Parameters to be passed to the function can have default values that are defined by constants of the appropriate type.</p>
        <p class="doctabhdr">Example:</p>
        <pre class="docmql4">
int somefunc(double a, double d=0.0001, int n=5, bool b=true, string s="passed string")
  {
   Print(&quot;Required parameter a=&quot;,a);
   Print(&quot;The following parameters are transmitted: d=&quot;,d,&quot; n=&quot;,n,&quot; b=&quot;,b,&quot; s=&quot;,s);
   return (0);
  }</pre>
        <p>If the default value was assigned to a parameter, all follow-up parameters must have the default value, too.</p>
        <p class="doctabhdr">Example of a wrong declaration:</p>

        <p>Arguments (<a href="help://basis_variables_formal">formal parameters</a>) are passed by value, i.e., 
      each expression <em>xl</em>, . . . , <em>xn</em> is calculated, and the value is passed to the function. The order of expressions calculation 
      and that of values loading are guaranteed. During the execution, the system checks the number and type of arguments given to the function. 
      Such way of addressing to the function is called a value call. Function call is an expression thy value of which is the value returned by the function. 
      The function type described above must correspond with the type of the returned value. The function can be declared or described in any part of the program
      on the global scope, i.e., outside other functions. The function cannot be declared or described inside of another function.</p>

  {
   return (a*x[0] + b);
  }</pre><br/>

        <p>At calling of a function with default parameters, the list of parameters to be passed can be limited,

somefunc(3.14);               // proper call
somefunc(3.14, 0.0002);       // proper call
somefunc(3.14, 0.0002, 10);   // proper call</pre><br/>

        <p>There are three functions with pre-defined names in MQL4:<br/><br/>

        <b>init()</b> is a function to be called during the module initialization. If it is not available, no function will be called at initialization.<br/><br/>

        <b>start()</b> is the basic function. For experts, it is called after the next tick has income. For custom indicators, it is called 
      at recalculation after the indicator has been attached to the chart, at opening of the client terminal (if the indicator is attached to the chart), 
      and after the next tick has income, as well. For scripts, it is executed immediately after the script has been attached to the chart 
      and initialized. If there is no start() function in the module, the module (expert, script, or custom indicator) cannot be launched.<br/><br/>

        <b>deinit()</b> is a function to be called during deinitialization of the module. If it is not available, no function will be called at deinitialization.</p>

        <p>Pre-defined functions can have some parameters. However, no parameters will be taken from outside when these functions 
      are called by the client terminal, but the default values will be used. Functions of <em>start()</em>, <em>init()</em>, and 
        <em>deinit()</em> can be called from any point of the module according to the common rules, equally to other functions.</p>
        
        <p>It is not recommended to call <em>start()</em> function from <em>init()</em> function or to perform trade operations, 
      as chart data, market prices, etc. can be incomplete by the moment of the module initialization. The <em>init()</em> and 
      <em>deinit()</em> functions must finish their working as soon as possible and, in no case, shall they loop when trying to 
      start its full-fledged working before the <em>start()</em> function is called.</p>

      <p>Variables must be declared before they are used. Unique names are used to identify variables. Descriptions of 
      variables are used for them to be defined and for types to be declared. Description is not an operator.</p>
      <p><b>The basic types are:</b></p>
      <ul>
          <li><a href="help://basis_types_bool">bool</a> - boolean values of <em>true</em> and <em>false</em>;</li>
          <li><a href="help://basis_types_string">string</a> - character strings;</li>
          <li><a href="help://basis_types_double">double</a> - double-precision numbers with floating point.</li>

            <li><a href="help://basis_types_datetime">datetime</a> is date and time, an unsigned integer containing seconds that 
         have passed since 0.00 a.m. on 1 January, 1970.</li>

</ul>
        <p>Additional data types make sense only at the declaration of <a href="help://basis_variables_extern">input parameters</a> for their more convenient 
       representation in the properties window.</p>
        <p class="doctabhdr">Example:</p>
<pre class="docmql4">

<p>Array is the indexed sequence of the identical-type data.</p>
        <pre class="docmql4">int    a[50];       // A one-dimensional array of 50 integers.
double m[7][50];    // Two-dimensional array of seven arrays, 
                    //each of them consisting of 50 integers.
        </pre><br/>

        <p>Only an integer can be an <a href="help://basis_operations_other">array index</a>. No more than four-dimensional arrays
      are allowed. Numbering of array elements starts with 0. The last element of a one-dimensional array has the number which is 
      1 less than the array size. This means that call for the last element of an array consisting of 50 integers will appear as 
      a[49]. The same concerns multidimensional arrays: A dimension is indexed from 0 to the <b>dimension size</b>-1.
        The last element of a two-dimensional array from the example will appear as m[6][49].</p>

        <p>If there is an attempt to access out of the array range, the executing subsystem will generate error named

       <p>A variable declared inside any function is local. The scope of a local variable is limited to the
      function range inside which it is declared. A local variable can be initialized by outcome of any expression. Every call of 
      the function initializes a local variable. Local variables are stored in memory area of the corresponding function.</p>
<p class="doctabhdr">Example:</p>

<p>Parameters <a href="help://basis_functions_call">passed to the function</a> are local. Scope is the function block. 
Formal parameters must have names differing from those of external variables and local variables defined within one 
function. In the block  of the function to the formal parameters some values can be assigned. Some values can be assigned to 
formal parameters in the function block.</p>
        <p class="doctabhdr">Example:</p>
        <pre class="docmql4">
void func(int x[], double y, bool z)
  {
   if(y&gt;0.0 &amp;&amp; !z)
      Print(x[0]);
   ...
  }</pre><br/>
<p>Formal parameters can be initialized by constants. In this case, the initializing value is considered as the default
value. Parameters, next to the intialized one, must also be initialized.</p>
        <p class="doctabhdr">Example:</p>
        <pre class="docmql4">void func(int x, double y = 0.0, bool z = true)
  {
   ...
  }</pre>

       <p>When calling such a function, the initialized parameters can be omitted, the defaults being substituted instead of them.</p>
       <p class="doctabhdr">Example:</p><pre class="docmql4">func(123, 0.5);</pre><br/>
       
       <p>MQL4-library functions <a href="help://basis_variables_extfunctions">imported</a> within other modules cannot have parameters initialized by default values.</p>
      
      <p>Parameters are passed by value, i.e., modifications of the corresponding local variable inside the called function 
      will not be shown in the calling function in any way. It is possible to pass arrays as parameters. However, for an array passed as parameter, 
      it is impossible to change values of its elements.</p>
      
      <p>It is also possible to pass parameters by reference. In this case, modification of such parameters will
      be shown in the corresponding variables in the called function passed by reference. Array elements cannot be passed by reference.
      Parameters can be passed by reference only within one module, such possibility being not provided for libraries.
      In order to inform that a parameter is passed by reference, it is necessary to put the &amp; modifier after the data type.</p>
       <p class="doctabhdr">Example:</p>
       <pre class="docmql4">
void func(int&amp; x, double&amp; y, double&amp; z[])
  {
   double calculated_tp;
   ...
   for(int i=0; i&lt;OrdersTotal(); i++)
     {
      if(i==ArraySize(z))       break;
      if(OrderSelect(i)==false) break;
      z[i]=OrderOpenPrice();
     }
   x=i;
   y=calculated_tp;
  }</pre><br/>
      <p>Arrays can be passed by reference, as well, all changes being shown in the source array. Unlike 
     simple parameters, arrays can be passed by reference into library functions, as well.<br/><br/>

      Parameters passed by reference cannot be initialized with defaults.<br/><br/>
      
      Into function cannot be passed more than 64 parameters.</p>

      <p>Static variables are stored in the permanent memory, their values do not get lost when the function is exited. 
      Any variables in a block, except for formal parameters of the function, can be defined as static. The static variable can be 
      initialized by a constant of the corresponded type, unlike a simple local variable which can be initialized by any expression. 
      If there is no explicit initialization, the static variable is initialized with zero. Static variables are initialized only once 
      before calling of the "init()" function, that is at exit from the function inside which the static variable is declared,

        <p>The <em>#include</em> command line can be placed anywhere in the program, but usually all inclusions
      are placed at the beginning of the source code. Call format:</p>
      <pre class="docmql4"><i>#include &lt;file_name&gt;
#include &quot;file_name&quot;;</i></pre><br/>

        <p class="doctabhdr">Examples:</p>
        <pre class="docmql4">
#include &lt;WinUser32.mqh&gt;
#include "mylib.mqh"</pre><br/>

        <p>Preprocessor replaces this line with the content of the file WinUser32.mqh. Angle brackets mean that the <em>WinUser32.mqh</em> file will be 
taken from the default directory (usually <em>terminal_directory\experts\include</em>). The current directory is not searched.</p>
        
        <p>If the file name is enclosed in quotation marks, the search will be performed in the current directory

      keywords=;import;DLL;EX4;
      <content>
        <p>Functions are imported from compiled MQL4 modules (*.ex4 files) and from operating system modules (*.dll 
      files). The module name is specified in the <em>#import</em> directive. For compiler to be able to form the imported 
      function call and pass parameters in a proper way, the full description of functions is needed. Functions descriptions 
      follow the <em>#import &quot;module name&quot;</em> immediately. The new <em>#import</em> command (can be without 
      parameters) completes the imported functions description block.</p>
        <pre class="docmql4"><i>#import "file_name"
    func1 define;
    func2 define;
    ...
    funcN define;
#import</i></pre><br/>
<p>Imported functions must have their unique names. Functions having the same names cannot be imported simultaneously 
from different modules. Imported functions names may not coincide with those of built-in functions.</p>
<p>Since the imported functions are out of the module to be compiled, the compiler cannot check correctness of parameters 
passed. This is why, to avoid runtime errors, it is necessary to declare the compliance of types and order of parameters precisely.
The parameters passed to imported functions (both from EX4 and from DLL modules) cannot have values by default.</p>
        <p class="doctabhdr">Examples:</p>
        <pre class="docmql4">#import "user32.dll"
   int    MessageBoxA(int hWnd, string lpText, string lpCaption, int uType);<br/>
#import "stdlib.ex4"
   string ErrorDescription(int error_code);
   int    RGB(int red_value, int green_value, int blue_value);
   bool   CompareDoubles(double number1, double number2);
   string DoubleToStrMorePrecision(double number, int precision);
   string IntegerToHexString(int integer_number);<br/>
#import "ExpertSample.dll"
   int    GetIntValue(int);
   double GetDoubleValue(double);
   string GetStringValue(string);
   double GetArrayItemValue(double arr[], int, int);
   bool   SetArrayItemValue(double&amp; arr[], int,int, double);
   double GetRatesItemValue(double rates[][6], int, int, int);
   int    SortStringArray(string&amp; arr[], int);
   int    ProcessStringArray(string&amp; arr[], int);
#import</pre><br/>

        <p>For importing of functions during execution of an mql4 program, the so-called <em>late binding</em> is used. 
        This means that until the imported function has not been called, the corresponding module (ex4 or dll) will not be loaded.</p>

        <p>It is not recommended to use the fully qualified name of loaded module appearing as 
        <em>Drive:\Directory\FileName.Ext</em>. MQL4 libraries are loaded from the <em>terminal_dir\experts\libraries</em> folder.
        If the library has not been found, there will be an attempt to load a library from the <em>terminal_dir\experts</em> folder.</p>

    For each executable MQL4 program, a number of predefined variables is supported that reflect the state of the current price chart 
     at the launching of a program: an expert, a script, or a custom indicator.<br/><br/>
    Libraries use variables of the module that has called a library.<br/><br/>
    To have a safe and quick access to these data, client terminal provides local copies of predefined variables for each launched 
     program separately. These data are updated at every launch of an attached expert or a custom indicator automatically or using the 
    <a href="help://windows_RefreshRates">RefreshRates()</a> function call.

    For an MQL4 program to work, it must be compiled (the "Compile" button or F5). It must be compiled 
    without any errors (warnings are allowed, but they must be analyzed). At this, in the corresponding directory, <em>terminal_dir\experts</em>,
    <em>terminal_dir\experts\indicators</em>, or <em>terminal_dir\experts\scripts</em>, an executable file must be created that has the same name 
    and extension EX4. It is this file that can be launched for execution.<br/><br/>
    Experts, custom indicators, and scripts are attached to one of the opened charts by dragging with the mouse from the "Navigator" window of the client
    terminal to the corresponding chart (the Drag'n'Drop technique). MQL4 programs can work only when the client terminal is on.<br/><br/>
    For an expert to stop working,it must be deleted from the chart using "Expert Advisors - Delete" in the chart context menu.
    The status of the "Enable Expert Advisors" field influences the running of the expert.<br/><br/>
    For a custom indicator to stop working, it must be deleted from the chart.<br/><br/>
    Custom indicators and expert advisors operate until they are explicitly deleted from the chart. Information about the attached experts and custom
    indicators is saved between client terminal startups. Scripts are executed once and deleted automatically after they have completed their operation, or
    when the current chart has been closed or changed its status, or when the client terminal has been terminated. Scripts are not launched at the terminal restart
    since information about them is not saved.<br/><br/>
    In the same chart, one expert, one script, and an unlimited amount of indicators can work simultaneously.

        <p>
        Immediately after the program has been attached to the chart, it starts working with the init() function. The init()
        function of an expert advisor or a custom indicator attached to the chart will run just after client terminal has started 
        and history data (this concerns only experts, but not indicators) have been loaded  additionally, after the symbol and/or 
        chart period have been changed, after the program has been recompiled in MetaEditor, after inputs have been changed from 
        the window of expert or custom indicator settings. An expert will also be initialized after the account has been changed.<br/><br/>
        
        Every program attached to a chart completes its work with the deinit() function. The deinit() function runs at the client 
        terminal shutdown, at chart closing,  immediately before the symbol and/or chart period is changed, at successful recompiling 
        of the program, at changing of inputs, or at changing of the account. One can see the reason of deinitialization using the 
        <a href="help://check_UninitializeReason">UninitializeReason()</a> function during execution of the deinit() function. The deinit() 
        function must be executed within 2.5 seconds. If the function has not completed its execution within this time period, it will 
        be completed forcedly. Scripts are an exception to this rule, as they normally finish their working independently, without any 
        commands from outside. If a script works very long (due to endless loop, foe example), it can be finished by an outside command 
        (at deletion of the script from the chart context menu, at attaching of a new script to the same chart, at closing of the chart, 
        at changing of the symbol and/or chart period). In this case, the deinit() function is limited by 2.5 seconds, too.<br/><br/>
        
        At incoming of new quotes, the start() function of the attached experts and custom indicators will be executed. If the start() 
        function launched at the preceding quote was running when a new quote came, the new quote will be skipped by the expert. All new 
        quotes income while the program was being executed are skipped by the program until the current execution of the start() function 
        has been completed.  After that, the start() function will be run only when a successive new quote incomes.
        For custom indicators, the start() function will be launched for recalculation after the current chart symbol or timeframe 
        has been changed independently on new quotes incoming.
        The start() function will not be run when the expert properties window is open. The latter cannot be opened during the expert execution.<br/><br/>
        
        Detaching of the program from the chart, change of symbol and/or chart period, change of the account, closing of the chart, as 
        well as shutdown of the client terminal will interrupt execution of the program. If the start() function was being executed at 
        the moment when the stop working command was given, the time remaining for its work is limited by 2.5 seconds. The program can 
        get to know that it is tried to shut it down with the built-in function of <a href="help://check_IsStopped">IsStopped()</a> and finish 
        its work correctly.<br/><br/>
        
        Execution of scripts does not depend on incoming quotes. At change of symbol and/or chart period, the script will finish its work 
        and be unloaded from the client terminal.<br/>
        Scripts and experts work in their own thread. Custom indicators work in the main interface thread. If a custom indicator has been called 
        with the <a href="help://indicators_iCustom">iCustom()</a> function, this indicator works in the thread of the program that has called it. 
        Library (imported) functions work in the calling program thread, as well.</p>

        To <a href="help://basis_preprosessor_import">import functions</a> during execution of an mql4 program, the so-called late binding is used. 
        This means that, until the imported function is called, the corresponding module (ex4 or dll) will not be loaded.
        MQL4 and DLL libraries are executed in the calling module thread.<br/><br/>

        It is not recommended to use a fully qualified name of the module to be loaded like <em>Drive:\Directory\FileName.Ext</em>. 
      MQL4 libraries are loaded from the <em>terminal_dir\experts\libraries</em> folder. If the library has not been found, 
      there will be made an attempt to load the library from the <em>terminal_dir\experts</em> folder.<br/><br/>

        System libraries (DLLs) are loaded by the rules of the operation system. If the library has already been loaded 
      (by another expert, for example, or from another client terminal launched at the same time), the library 
      already loaded will be referenced to. Otherwise, the searching will be preformed in the following order:<br/>
        1. The <em>terminal_dir\experts\libraries</em> directory.<br/>
        2. The directory from which the <em>terminal_dir</em> client terminal was launched.<br/>
        3. The current directory.<br/>
        4. The system directory of <em>windows_dir\SYSTEM32</em> (or <em>windows_dir\SYSTEM</em> for Win98).<br/>
        5. The directory where <em>windows_dir</em> operation system was installed.<br/>
        6. Directories listed in the PATH environment system variable.<br/><br/>

        If a DLL uses another DLL in its work, the former one will not be loaded if the latter one is unavailable.<br/><br/>

        Unlike system libraires, custom libraries (MQL4) are loaded for every calling module separately, independently on whether 
        the called library has been loaded by any other module. For example, the caller.ex4 module calls functions from lib1.ex4 and 
      lib2.ex4 libraries. The lib1.ex4 library, in its turn, calls functions from the lib2.ex4 library. In this case, 
      one more copy of the lib1.ex4 library and two copies of the lib2.ex4 library will be loaded, regardless that all calls  
        come from the same caller.ex4 module.<br/><br/>

        Functions imported from DLL into an mql4 program must provide linkage convention accepted for Windows API functions.
        To provide such a convention, the key word __stdcall specific for compilers of Microsoft(r) company is used in the source codes 
      of programs written in C or C++ language. The above linkage convention is characterized by the following:<br/>
         - calling function (in our case, it is an mql4 program) must "see" the called (imported from DLL) function prototype 
       in order to put parameters onto the stack in a proper way;<br/>
         - calling function (in our case, it is an mql4 program) puts parameters onto the stack in the reversed order, i.e., from right 
       to left; it is this order in which the imported function reads parameters passed to it;<br/>
         - parameters are passed by their values, except for those explicitely passed by a link (in our case, these are lines);<br/>
         - on reading the parameters passed to it, the imported function will flush the stack by itself.<br/><br/>

         At describing of the imported <a href="help://basis_functions">function</a> prototype, it is useless to use parameters with 
       default values as all parameters must be passed explicitely to the imported function.<br/><br/>

         If the call for an imported function failed (expert settings do not allow DLL imports, or the corresponding 
       library could not be loaded for any reason), the expert stops working putting the corresponding message into the "expert stopped" 
       journal. At that, the expert will not be launched until it is re-initialized. An expert can be re-initialized as a result of 
       recompiling or opening of the expert properties table and pressing of OK button.

         In the executing sub-system of the client terminal, the error code can be stored, in the case of its occurring 
       at an mql4 program execution. There is a specific <i>last_error</i> variable provided for every executable mql4 program.
       Before the init function is run, the <i>last_error</i> variable has been zeroized. If an error occurs during the process of 
       calculation or that of calling the built-in function, the <i>last_error</i> variable takes the corresponding
       <a href="help://constants_errors">error code</a>. Value stored in this variable can be got using the <a href="help://check_GetLastError">GetLastError</a> function.

    A group of functions to work with arrays.<br/><br/>
    Arrays are allowed to be maximum four-dimensional. Each dimension is indexed from 0 to <b>dimension size</b>-1.
    In a particular case of a one-dimensional array of 50 elements, calling of the first element will appear as array[0], of the last one - as array[49].<br/><br/>
    Using these functions (except for those which change quantitative and qualitative characteristics of the array) one can process 
    predefined time series <a href="help://predefined_variables_time">Time[]</a>, <a href="help://predefined_variables_open">Open[]</a>,

      type=int
      <content>
        If the element with the specified value doesn't exist in the array, the function returns the index of the nearest smallest value of the elements between which the searched value is located.<br/>
        The function cannot be used with string arrays and series arrays (with the exception of the series array of the bar open time).<br/>
        Note: Binary search processes only sorted arrays.
        To sort numeric arrays use the <a href="help://array_ArraySort">ArraySort()</a> function.
      </content>
      <example>
   datetime daytimes[];
   int      shift=10,dayshift;

0 - time,<br/>
1 - open,<br/>
2 - low,<br/>
3 - high,<br/>
4 - close,<br/>
5 - volume.<br/><br/>
If data (symbol name and/or timeframe differ from the current ones) are requested from another chart, the situation is possible 
that the corresponding chart was not opened in the client terminal and the necessary data must be requested from the server. In this case, 
<a href="help://constants_errors">error</a> ERR_HISTORY_WILL_UPDATED (4066 - the requested history data are under updating) will be placed 
in the <a href="help://runtime_errors">last_error</a> variable, and one will has to re-request (see example of <a href="help://array_ArrayCopySeries">ArrayCopySeries()</a>).<br/><br/>
Notes: This rates array is normally used to pass data to a DLL function.<br/>
Memory is not really allocated for data array, and no real copying is performed. When such an array is accessed, the access will be redirected.

        the access is redirected. Excluded are arrays that are <a href="help://customind_SetIndexBuffer">assigned as indexed ones</a>
        in custom indicators. In this case, data are really copied.<br/><br/>
        If data are copied from another chart with different symbol and/or timeframe, it is possible that the necessary data will lack.
        In this case, <a href="help://constants_errors">error</a> ERR_HISTORY_WILL_UPDATED (4066 - requested history data 
        under updating) will be placed into the <a href="help://runtime_errors">last_error</a> variable,

        Note: If series_index is MODE_TIME, the array to be passed to the function must be of the datetime type.

The function returns the amount of bars not changed after the indicator had been launched last. The most calculated bars do not need any recalculation.
In most cases, same count of index values do not need for recalculation. The function is used to optimize calculating.<br/><br/>
Note: The latest bar is not considered to be calculated and, in the most cases, it is necessary to recalculate only this bar. However, there occur 
some boundary cases where custom indicator is called from the expert at the first tick of the new bar. It is possible that the last tick of the previous bar 
had not been processed (because the last-but-one tick <a href="help://runtime_start">was being processed</a> when this last tick came), the custom 
indicator was not called and it was not calculated because of this. To avoid indicator calculation errors in such situations, the IndicatorCounted() 
function returns the count of bars minus one.

        Calculation of the Relative Strength Index on data stored in a numeric array.
        Unlike iRSI(...), the iRSIOnArray function does not take data by symbol name,

        The indicator is calculated from left to right. To access to the array elements as to a series array 
        (i.e., from right to left), one has to use the <a href="help://array_ArraySetAsSeries">ArraySetAsSeries</a> function.

    Trading functions of <a href="help://trading_OrderSend">OrderSend()</a>, <a href="help://trading_OrderClose">OrderClose</a>,
    <a href="help://trading_OrderCloseBy">OrderCloseBy</a>, <a href="help://trading_OrderDelete">OrderDelete</a>, and <a href="help://trading_OrderModify">OrderModify</a>
    cannot be called from custom indicators.<br/><br/>
    Trading functions can be used in experts and scripts. Trading functions can be called only if the "Allow live trading" property of this particular expert is checked.<br/><br/>
    To trade from experts and scripts, only one thread was provided that was launched in the program trade context (context of 
    automated trading from experts and scripts). This is why, if this context is occupied with an expert trading operation, 
    another expert or script cannot call trading functions at that moment due to <a href="help://constants_errors">error</a> 146 (ERR_TRADE_CONTEXT_BUSY). 
    To check whether it is possible to trade or not, one has to use the <a href="help://check_IsTradeAllowed">IsTradeAllowed()</a> function. 
    To make a clear sharing of access to the trading context, one can use a semaphore on the basis of a global variable  
    the value of which must be changed using the <a href="help://globals_GlobalVariableSetOnCondition">GlobalVariableSetOnCondition()</a> function.

The function selects an order for further processing. It returns TRUE if the function succeeds.
It returns FALSE if the function fails.
To get the error information, one has to call the <a href="help://check_GetLastError">GetLastError()</a> function.<br/>
The <i>pool</i> parameter is ignored if the order is selected by the ticket number. The ticket number is a unique order identifier.
To find out from what list the order has been selected, its <a href="help://trading_OrderCloseTime">close time</a> must be analyzed. If the order close time 
equals to 0, the order is open or pending and taken from the terminal open positions list. One can distinguish an open position from a pending order
by the <a href="help://trading_OrderType">order type</a>. If the order <a href="help://trading_OrderCloseTime">close time</a> does not equal to 0, the order is
a <a href="help://trading_OrderClose">closed</a> order or a <a href="help://trading_OrderDelete">deleted</a> pending order and was selected from the terminal history. 
They also differ from each other by their <a href="help://trading_OrderType">order types</a>.

The main function used to open a position or place a pending order.<br/>
Returns number of the ticket assigned to the order by the trade server or -1 if it fails.
To get additional error information, one has to call the <a href="help://check_GetLastError">GetLastError()</a> function.<br/>
Notes:<br/>
At opening of a market order (OP_SELL or OP_BUY), only the latest prices of <a href="help://predefined_variables_Bid">Bid</a> (for selling) or 
<a href="help://predefined_variables_Ask">Ask</a> (for buying) can be used as open price. If operation is performed with a security differing from 
the current one, the <a href="help://common_MarketInfo">MarketInfo()</a> function must be used with MODE_BID or MODE_ASK parameter 
for the latest quotes for this security to be obtained. Calculated or unnormalized price cannot be applied.
If there has not been the requested open price in the price thread or it has not been normalized according to the <a href="help://predefined_variables_Digits">amount 
of digits after decimal point</a>, the <a href="help://constants_errors">error</a> 129 (ERR_INVALID_PRICE) will be generated. If the requested
open price is fully out of date, the <a href="help://constants_errors">error</a> 138 (ERR_REQUOTE) will be generated independently on the <i>slippage</i> 
parameter. If the requested price is out of date, but present in the thread, the position will be opened at the current price and only if 
the current price lies within the range of <i>price</i>+-<i>slippage</i>.<br/><br/>
StopLoss and TakeProfit levels cannot be too close to the market. The minimal distance of stop levels in points can be obtained using the 
<a href="help://common_MarketInfo">MarketInfo()</a> function with MODE_STOPLEVEL parameter. In the case of erroneous or unnormalized stop levels, the 
<a href="help://constants_errors">error</a> 130 (ERR_INVALID_STOPS) will be generated.<br/><br/>
At placing of a pending order, the open price cannot be too close to the market. The minimal distance of the pending price from the current market one
in points can be obtained using the <a href="help://common_MarketInfo">MarketInfo()</a> function with the MODE_STOPLEVEL parameter. In case of false open price
of a pending order, the <a href="help://constants_errors">error</a> 130 (ERR_INVALID_STOPS) will be generated.<br/><br/>
Applying of pending order expiration time can be disabled in some trade servers. In this case, when a non-zero value is specified 
in the <i>expiration</i> parameter, the <a href="help://constants_errors">error</a> 147 (ERR_TRADE_EXPIRATION_DENIED) will be generated.<br/><br/>
On some trade servers, the <a href="help://trading_OrdersTotal">total amount</a> of open and pending orders can be limited.
If this limit has been exceeded, no new position will be opened (or no pending order will be placed) and trade server will return <a href="help://constants_errors">error</a>
148 (ERR_TRADE_TOO_MANY_ORDERS).

      <content>
 Refreshing of data in <a href="help://predefined_variables">pre-defined variables and series arrays</a>.
 This function is used when expert advisor has been calculating for a long time and needs data refreshing.
 Returns TRUE if data are refreshed, otherwise returns FALSE. The only reason for data cannot be refreshed is that 
 they are the current data of the client terminal.<br/><br/>
 Experts and scripts operate with their own copy of history data. Data of the current symbol are copied at the first launch of the expert or script.
 At each subsequent launch of the expert (remember that script is <a href="help://runtime_start">executed</a> only once and does not depend on 
 incoming ticks), the initial copy will be updated. One or more new ticks can income while the expert or script is operating, 
 and data can become out of date.

in the reverse order, from the last to the first one.
The current bar, the latest in the price array, is indexed as 0. The oldest bar is indexed as <a href="help://predefined_variables_Bars">Bars</a>-1.
If the first visible bar number is 2 or more bars less than <a href="help://windows_WindowBarsPerChart">the amount of visible bars in the chart</a>,
it means that the chart window has not been fully filled out and there is a space to the left.

      <content>
        Returns window index where expert, custom indicator or script was dropped.
        This value is valid if the expert, custom indicator or script was dropped by mouse.<br/>
        Note: For custom indicators being initialized (call from the <i>init()</i> function), this index is not defined.<br/>
        The returned index is the number of window (0-chart main menu, subwindows of indicators are numbered starting from 1) where the custom indicator 
        is working. A custom indicator can create its own new subwindow during its work, and the number of this subwindow will differ from that of the window 
        where the indicator was really dropped in.<br/>

	<content>
<p>In 2010, MetaQuotes Software Corp. released the new <a href="http://www.metatrader5.com/en" title="MetaTrader 5" target="_blank">MetaTrader 5</a> online trading platform. In the new platform, we have implemented a lot of traders' wishes and added the ability to trade various exchange-traded instruments.</p>
<p>The MetaTrader 5 Client Terminal is now equipped with a new multicurrency tester, which allows using all the available computer cores during optimization. Moreover, by connecting remote testing agents, the time of Expert Advisor optimization can be hundred times reduced. The tester provides the most convenient and easy way to add, delete and control remote agents.</p>
<p>MetaEditor 5 allows to debug programs, contains the built-in automatic code completion function and provides many other improvements. With the new <a href="http://www.metatrader5.com/en/metaeditor/help/MQL5_wizard" title="MQL5 Wizard" target="_blank">MQL5 Wizard</a>, you need only four mouse clicks to create your own trading robot even if you don't have programming skills. You go through the required steps selecting the type of trading signals, the money management block and the Trailing Stop system, and you get an Expert Advisor ready for compilation and use.</p>
<p>But all these advantages would not be complete without the new MQL5 programming language, in which the following new features have been implemented:</p>
<ul>
  <li>object-oriented programming (OOP);</li>
  <li>processing trade and custom events;</li>
  <li>a large number of new graphical objects and properties.</li>
</ul>

<p>The execution speed of MQL5 programs has increased greatly and is now very close to the speed of C++. So the developers of MQL5 programs do not need to transfer heavy mathematical calculations to DLL.</p>
<p>To make the new language study as convenient as possible, the <a href="http://www.mql5.com/en" title="www.mql5.com/en" target="_blank">MQL5.community</a> website contains a lot of new <a href="http://www.mql5.com/en/articles" title="Articles about MQL5" target="_blank">articles</a> and codes, the on-line language reference and the new <a href="http://www.mql5.com/en/job" title="Order programs in MQL4" target="_blank">Jobs</a> service, where you can order programs in MQL4 and MQL5. More services will be added soon: account monitoring, Expert Advisors store, signals sales and a site of remote testing agents.</p>
<p>If you know MQL4, then it will be easy for you to learn the new MQL5. New features are worth it.</p>
